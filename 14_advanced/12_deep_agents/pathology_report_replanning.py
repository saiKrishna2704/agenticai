# =====================================================================
# Replanning, isolated as its own concept - distinct from Planning
# (study_plan_plan_execute.py) and Reflection (meal_plan_reflection.py)
# in this folder. Same plan_step -> execute_step -> replan_step shape,
# but the scenario is specifically engineered so replan_step has real
# work to do: a corrected re-read of the patient's original marker
# (recheck_marker_a, scripted to ALWAYS reverse the finding) arrives
# partway through executing a plan that was built on the original,
# since-superseded result - forcing the plan to actually change rather
# than just being confirmed step by step, the way the deleted
# plan_execute_replan.py's F1 task never really did.
#
# All patient data, marker names, and test results below are entirely
# synthetic/fictional (recommend_followups is a fixed lookup table, not
# the LLM inventing clinical judgment) - this demonstrates REPLANNING
# MECHANICS, not real diagnostic or treatment logic. Not medical
# software; nothing here should inform an actual health decision.
