# =====================================================================
# Self-improving agent: an evaluation score doesn't just grade one
# answer, it decides whether to persist a lesson that changes FUTURE
# answers on different, unrelated queries. Unlike multi_turn_reflection.py
# (which loops within a single task until it scores well), nothing here
# loops - each query runs the graph once, and improvement shows up
# later, on a completely different query that benefits from a lesson an
# earlier query's low score left behind in a real persistent store.
#
# The grader's ground truth is pulled from REAL rows of 15_real/
# customer_support_qa_500.csv (the same dataset episodic_memory_store.py
# and memory_consolidation.py use) instead of a hand-written policy sheet.
