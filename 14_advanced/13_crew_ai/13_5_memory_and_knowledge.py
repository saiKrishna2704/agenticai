# Memory vs Knowledge (they answer different questions):
#   - Knowledge: "What information do I need to know?" - static
#     reference material an agent can look things up in. Two sources
#     here: a hand-written glossary (StringKnowledgeSource) and a real
#     one-page PDF reference, Buffett_Munger_Top_10_Investment_Ratios.pdf
#     (PDFKnowledgeSource) - a genuine "Buffett & Munger-style" ratio
#     checklist (ROE, ROIC, debt-to-equity, etc.) with what each ratio
#     means and what to look for. A knowledge_sources list can combine
#     several real documents like this, not just one.
#   - Memory: "What do I remember from previous interactions?" -
#     carried across separate crew.kickoff() calls when memory=True.
#     Here it's the user's stated risk tolerance from an earlier
#     kickoff, applied automatically on a LATER, unrelated kickoff
#     that never restates it.
# Flow State (see 13_2) is neither of these - it's temporary context
# for ONE run, gone once that Flow finishes.
#
# Contrast with 14_advanced/12_deep_agents/: those scripts hand-roll a
# persistent Chroma store to get this same behavior explicitly. Here
# memory=True and knowledge_sources=[...] get it from CrewAI itself.

INVESTING_GLOSSARY = """
P/E ratio (price-to-earnings): share price divided by earnings per share; a
rough measure of how expensive a stock is relative to its profits.
Market cap: share price multiplied by total shares outstanding; the total
market value of the company.
Dividend yield: annual dividend per share divided by share price; how much
cash income a stock pays relative to its price.
Beta: a stock's volatility relative to the overall market; beta above 1
means it tends to swing more than the market, below 1 means less.
