# =====================================================================
# Hierarchical crews and manager agents: in a sequential crew, the
# workflow is fixed (Researcher -> Analyst -> Writer, always in that
# order). In a hierarchical crew, a manager agent decides who should
# do what: it understands the objective, delegates sub-questions to
# the right specialist, reviews their results, decides if anything
# needs more work, and coordinates the final output - the manager
# never does the specialist research itself (allow_delegation=True is
# implicit for the manager; CrewAI creates/uses it, not a worker).
#
# NOTE (per the slide): if the workflow is straightforward and not
# actually agentic - e.g. a fixed 3-step pipeline like 13_1's - a
# hierarchical crew is unnecessary overhead. It earns its keep here
# because the manager genuinely doesn't know in advance how many
# specialists it needs to consult, or in what order, to answer an
# open-ended "should we buy this stock?" question.
