# =====================================================================
# Step 8 - Two things land together, as they do in the deck (slides
# 10-11):
#
# 1. AUTHENTICATION. A login gate (mock_idp.authenticate) replaces
#    trusting whatever customer ID appears in chat text. Every specialist
#    call is now scoped SERVER-SIDE via scope_tool_to_customer() below -
#    the LLM's own customer_id argument, if it supplies one, is silently
#    discarded and overridden with the authenticated session's ID. This
#    is a real fix, not cosmetic: since step 2, any customer could type
#    a DIFFERENT customer's ID and the tools would have trusted it. It
#    also removes the "please provide your customer ID" friction that's
#    been in every specialist prompt since step 2 - the system already
#    knows who's asking.
#
#    A second, narrower gate: update_kyc requires "standard" auth level.
#    CUST1003 (Sancy) is deliberately the one "restricted" account (see
#    mock_idp.py), matching slide 10's John/Sancy example - this build
#    has no credit-limit tool, so KYC update stands in for the
#    "elevated operation" the deck demos.
#
# 2. SESSION STORE. A tiny checkpointed "memory" graph (mirroring
#    3_langgraph/3_4_langgraph_memory.py's simple accumulate-via-
#    SqliteSaver pattern) persists conversation history per customer_id,
#    surviving a full app restart - closing the deck's "Sanjay" gap
#    (slide 11): a customer asking about something from a prior session
#    no longer gets "I have no record of that."
#
#    The coordinator graph (classify/dispatch/run_specialist/synthesize)
#    deliberately stays UNCHECKPOINTED, exactly as it worked in steps
#    6-7: specialist_replies uses operator.add, which accumulates
#    correctly WITHIN one turn's parallel fan-out, but would accumulate
#    WITHOUT bound ACROSS turns if that graph itself were checkpointed
#    (an empty-list input doesn't reset an operator.add channel - it's
#    additive, not a replacement). Splitting "durable message history"
#    (the memory graph) from "this turn's scratch orchestration state"
#    (the coordinator graph) sidesteps that landmine entirely - only the
#    conversation actually needs to survive across turns/restarts, and
#    add_messages (merge-by-id) is safe to accumulate forever in a way
#    operator.add on scratch fields is not.
