# Step 7 - Move Accounts/Transaction/Service's tool implementations out
# of this process entirely, into three separate MCP servers
# (accounts_mcp_server.py, transaction_mcp_server.py,
# service_mcp_server.py - one stdio subprocess each), following
# 6_mcp/6_22_langgraph_agent_mcp_tools.py's MultiServerMCPClient
# pattern. The seven @tool-decorated functions from step 6 are gone
# from this file - only their MCP server counterparts remain, and this
# file now just asks the MCP client for whatever tools each server
# exposes. Upgrading a banking API backend now only means changing the
# relevant server file; this agent file doesn't change. FAQ Agent is
# unchanged - MCP is a tool-calling concept, and FAQ has no tools, only
# a retriever, so there's nothing to move for it.
#
# MCP tools from langchain_mcp_adapters are async-only, so
# make_specialist_agent's agent node became `async def` (llm_with_tools
# .ainvoke instead of .invoke), and the coordinator's run_specialist -
# itself a plain sync function called inside a Send-dispatch worker
# thread - now runs each specialist via asyncio.run(app.ainvoke(...))
# instead of app.invoke(...). The coordinator graph itself is still
# invoked synchronously from the Streamlit UI (coordinator_app.invoke) -
# only the inner specialist graphs needed to become async-invokable.

Identify which specialist(s) are needed to answer the customer's MOST RECENT \

ONE specialist - only include more than one if the message explicitly asks for \
multiple distinct things at once. A topic merely sounding related to a \
specialist's domain is not a reason to include it - only include a specialist \
if the message needs THAT specialist's own capability.

A short reply with no question in it (e.g. just a customer ID or an address) is \
usually answering something the assistant asked for in the immediately preceding \
turn - route it to whichever specialist needed that missing information, not to \
faq just because it isn't phrased as a question itself.

- accounts: balance enquiries
- transaction: transaction history or statement requests
- service: address changes, cheque book requests, KYC updates
- faq: general banking questions not about this specific customer's account \
(how do I..., what is your policy on..., procedures)

Examples:
- "What is my balance?" -> accounts
- "What is my balance and show me my last 5 transactions?" -> accounts, transaction
- "Please update my address" -> service (NOT accounts, even though it's account-related)
- "How do I report a lost debit card?" -> faq (NOT service - no specific customer \
action is being requested, this is a general procedure question)
- Assistant just asked "Please provide your customer ID so I can check your \
balance", customer replies "CUST1001" -> accounts (this is the missing customer \
ID for the balance request, not a new FAQ question)""")
