Identify which specialist(s) are needed to answer the customer's MOST RECENT \
message, using the conversation above for context. Most messages need exactly \
ONE specialist - only include more than one if the message explicitly asks for \
multiple distinct things at once. A topic merely sounding related to a \
specialist's domain is not a reason to include it - only include a specialist \
if the message needs THAT specialist's own capability.

A short reply with no question in it (e.g. just a customer ID or an address) is \
usually answering something the assistant asked for in the immediately preceding \
turn - route it to whichever specialist needed that missing information, not to \
faq just because it isn't phrased as a question itself.

- accounts: balance enquiries
- transaction: transaction history or statement requests
- service: address changes, cheque book requests, KYC updates
- faq: general banking questions not about this specific customer's account \
(how do I..., what is your policy on..., procedures)

Examples:
- "What is my balance?" -> accounts
- "What is my balance and show me my last 5 transactions?" -> accounts, transaction
- "Please update my address" -> service (NOT accounts, even though it's account-related)
- "How do I report a lost debit card?" -> faq (NOT service - no specific customer \
action is being requested, this is a general procedure question)
- Assistant just asked "Please provide your customer ID so I can check your \
balance", customer replies "CUST1001" -> accounts (this is the missing customer \
ID for the balance request, not a new FAQ question)""")
