# Step 4 - Split the one unscoped agent from step 3 into three domain
# specialists, each bound to only its own tools. There is deliberately
# NO coordinator yet (that's step 6, after step 5 adds a fourth - RAG -
# specialist) - nothing in this script picks which specialist handles a
# request. The UI makes that gap visible by requiring a human to pick
# the specialist manually, exactly the problem slide 7 surfaces: "who
# decides which specialist to call?"
